  <h1>About Shannon Stoltz-Limin</h1>
       <img src="dadandmechristmas.jpg" alt="Me with Dad when I was really young" width="300" height="400">

  <p>My name is Shannon, I'm 26 years old, a wife, mother of four furbabies (3 cats and a dog)Kira, Jacy, Merlin and Lalit;, a video gamer, movie and book addict.<br>
     I'm also a writer who's aspiring to become published,  I have many manuscripts in progress, only one is complete, just waiting to be edited before I can send it off. <br>
     Writing to me is as necessary as breathing, if I go too long without writing something not school related, I hit a really low point mentally and have a hard time <br>
     functioning like a regular human being. Which means, I don't sleep, I lose focus and can't concentrate on important things (like school work etc), and overall <br>
     really hard to be around. It's a way to keep my emotions under control, I guess is the best way to put it. </p>
     <p>The photo above is me and my dad when I was extremely young, I couldn't have been more than 3 when this was taken</p>

<p>I married my best friend Dominic on September 4th, 2015. He's put up with me changing programs a few times, this is my 4th program and 3rd college in about 7 nearly 8 years.<br>
  I'm looking forward to sticking with this one and getting a good career out of it.
